Hello :)

Tests are declarated by #[test]

To run tests:
- go to dr_ones path
- cargo test -> this automatically tests every test present in the folder

We can filter tests (if we don't want to run all of them) by doing
- cargo test function_name
- cargo test partial_function_name -> in this way it will run all the functions that contain this last string, but not the others

If we have some common setup / test environment, follow the things writte in adder/tests/common and adder/tests/integration_test.rs
